Sukhasana (Sanskrit: सुखासन, romanized: Sukhāsana), easy pose, is a simple cross-legged sitting asana in hatha yoga, sometimes used for meditation in both Buddhism and Hinduism.
The name comes from the Sanskrit words सुख sukha, "pleasure", and आसन āsana, "posture" or "seat".

The 19th century Sritattvanidhi describes and illustrates the pose. The name, and the more general name Yogasana which may denote a variety of similar poses, is found in much older documents as a meditation seat, such as in the 4th century Darshana Upanishad.
