# {{title}}
Utthita Vasisthasana (sometimes shortened to Vasisthasana) or Side Plank pose is a balancing asana in modern yoga as exercise. The pose is a balancing posture with the body, both legs, and both arms straight, the body on one side. The upper arm is raised as high as possible. The upper leg may be rested on the lower leg, or for the full pose (sometimes called Eka Pada Vasisthasana, One-legged Side Plank) may be raised as high as possible; the upper hand may grasp the foot (sometimes called Vasisthasana B), and the gaze may be directed to the upper hand.
