Bālāsana  बालासन, Child's Pose, or Child's Resting Pose is a kneeling asana in modern yoga as exercise. Balasana is a counter asana for various asanas and is usually practiced before and after Sirsasana.

## Etymology and origins
The name comes from the Sanskrit words बाल bala, "child" and आसन āsana, "posture" or "seat".Balasana is not described until the 20th century; a similar pose appears in Niels Bukh's 1924 Primary Gymnastics.Ananda Balasana is illustrated as Kandukasana (Ball Pose) in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi.
