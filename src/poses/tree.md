Vrikshasana वृक्षासन or Tree Pose is a balancing asana. It is one of the very few standing poses in medieval hatha yoga, and remains popular in modern yoga as exercise.
The name comes from the Sanskrit words vṛkṣa (वृक्ष) meaning "tree", and āsana (आसन) meaning "posture".
A 7th-century stone carving in Mahabalipuram appears to contain a figure standing on one leg, perhaps indicating that a pose similar to vrikshasana was in use at that time. It is said that sadhus disciplined themselves by choosing to meditate in the pose.The pose is described in the 17th century Gheraṇḍa Saṃhitā
