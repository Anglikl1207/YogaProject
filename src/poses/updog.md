Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana  ऊर्ध्वमुखश्वानासन  or Upward Facing Dog Pose is a back-bending asana in modern yoga as exercise. It is commonly part of the widely-performed Surya Namaskar (Salute to the Sun) sequence,though the similar Bhujangasana (cobra pose) may be used there instead.

The name of the pose is from the Sanskrit ऊर्ध्व Urdhva, "upwards"; मुख Mukha, "face"; and श्वान Shvana, "dog".The pose is one of those (along with Downward Dog) introduced by Krishnamacharya in the mid-20th century from Surya Namaskar, not then considered to be yoga, and later taught by his pupils
