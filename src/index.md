        <p>An asana or pose is a posture, whether for traditional hatha yoga or for modern yoga;  the term is derived from the Sanskrit word for 'seat'. While many of the oldest mentioned asanas are indeed seated postures for meditation, asanas may be standing, seated, arm-balances, twists, inversions, forward bends, backbends, or reclining in prone or supine positions. </p>
